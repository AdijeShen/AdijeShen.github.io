I am a cryptographic engineer at China Telecom, with a graduate degree in cryptography from the Trusted Digital Technology Lab at East China Normal University. My research focuses on privacy-preserving computation, particularly Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC). I am passionate about advancing the field of secure computation and aim to contribute to its development.
